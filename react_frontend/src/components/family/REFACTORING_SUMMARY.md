### 🔧 Custom Hooks

#### `useFamilyOrganization.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles family member organization logic
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes relationships data
  - Implements age-based fallback logic
  - Validates parent-child relationships
  - Returns organized family structure

#### `useTreeDimensions.ts`
- **Purpose**: Calculates tree layout dimensions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calculates node positions and spacing
  - Handles multi-row layout calculations
  - Determines container dimensions
  - Returns tree layout configuration

#### `useDragAndDrop.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages drag and drop functionality
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Tracks member positions
  - Handles mouse events
  - Manages drag state
  - Provides random positioning utilities

### 🛠️ Utility Functions

#### `calculations.ts`
- **Purpose**: Contains calculation helpers
- **Functions**:
  - `calculateCenteredPosition()` - Node positioning
  - `formatNameWithAge()` - Name formatting
  - `formatAge()` - Age calculation
  - `calculateMultiRowLayout()` - Multi-row layout

### 🎨 UI Components

#### `ParentGeneration.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders parent generation nodes
- **Features**:
  - Drag and drop support
  - Responsive positioning
  - Age display
  - Visual styling

#### `ChildGeneration.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders child generation nodes
- **Features**:
  - Single and multi-row layouts
  - Drag and drop support
  - Responsive positioning
  - Age display

#### `RelationshipConnections.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders relationship lines and connections
- **Features**:
  - Parent-child connections
  - Spouse connections
  - Fallback connections
  - Dynamic positioning
