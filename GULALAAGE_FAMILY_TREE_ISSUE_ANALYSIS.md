# Gulalaage Family Tree Issue Analysis

## Issue Summary
The user reported that only 3 members are visible in the family tree for "gulalaage, sh. maroshi" when there should be more members. The user mentioned seeing:
- Mohamed Umar (63) as single parent
- Ahmed Afrah and Idrees Umar as children

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Investigation Results

**Address Variations Found:**
- The database contains 261 entries with "gulalaage" in the address across 45 different address variations
- The specific address "gulalaage, sh. maroshi" has only 4 entries:
  1. abdul rahman ibrahim (Age: 82, DOB: 01/01/1943)
  2. ziyaaul haqqu (Age: 41, DOB: 31/05/1984) 
  3. anisa abdul rahman (Age: 40, DOB: 14/12/1985)
  4. hawwa abdulla (Age: 80, DOB: 01/01/1945)

**Family Group Status:**
- No family group exists for "gulalaage, sh. maroshi"
- However, there IS a family group for "gulalaage, b. thulhaadhoo" (ID: 1303) with 7 members:
  1. mohamed umar (Age: 63, DOB: 15/10/1962)
  2. aminath umar (Age: 57, DOB: 10/22/1968)
  3. fathimath umar (Age: 55, DOB: 23/10/1970)
  4. hawwa umar (Age: 58, DOB: 03/10/1967)
  5. shaheema umar (Age: 49, DOB: 01/15/1976)
  6. ahmed afrah (No DOB)
  7. idrees umar (No DOB)

### 2. The Real Issue

**The user is looking at the wrong address!**

The family members the user mentioned (mohamed umar, ahmed afrah, idrees umar) are actually located at:
- **Address:** gulalaage
- **Island:** b. thulhaadhoo (NOT sh. maroshi)

The family group exists and contains all 7 members, but the user is searching for "gulalaage, sh. maroshi" which has a completely different set of 4 people.

### 3. Why Only 3 Members Show

The user mentioned seeing only 3 members, which suggests they might be:
1. Looking at a different family group
2. The family tree display is filtering out some members
3. There's a display issue in the frontend

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Correct Address:** The user should search for "gulalaage, b. thulhaadhoo" instead of "gulalaage, sh. maroshi"
2. **Verify Family Group:** The family group ID 1303 exists and contains all 7 members

### Verification Steps
1. Search for family at "gulalaage, b. thulhaadhoo"
2. Verify all 7 members are displayed
3. Check if the family tree relationships are properly created

### Potential Frontend Issues
If the user is still seeing only 3 members when viewing the correct address, there might be:
1. **Filtering Logic:** The frontend might be filtering out members without DOB
2. **Display Logic:** The family tree might have display limitations
3. **Relationship Logic:** Some members might not be properly connected in relationships
