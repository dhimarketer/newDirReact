        # This migration is intentionally empty because:
        # 1. The model already has the correct ForeignKey definitions with db_column
        # 2. The database already has the correct structure (atoll_fk_id, island_fk_id, etc.)
        # 3. The data has been cleaned up (old text values removed)
        # 4. Django will automatically use the db_column mappings
        
        # No operations needed - the model and database are already in sync
