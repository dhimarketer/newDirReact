# 🔍 Smart Search Database Analysis

This directory contains tools to analyze the existing database for smart search optimization.

## 📋 Files

- **`analyze_search_patterns.py`** - Python script for comprehensive database analysis
- **`analyze_search_patterns.sql`** - SQL queries for direct database analysis
- **`README_ANALYSIS.md`** - This file

## 🚀 Running the Analysis

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)

The Python script provides comprehensive analysis with detailed recommendations.

```bash
# Navigate to the Django backend directory
cd django_backend

# Activate your virtual environment (if using one)
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Run the analysis script
python analyze_search_patterns.py
```

**What it analyzes:**
- Political party patterns and frequency
- Address patterns, suffixes, and prefixes
- Island and atoll patterns with misspelling detection
- Name patterns and structure
- Profession patterns and categories
- Overall database statistics

**Output:**
- Console summary with key findings
- Detailed results saved to `search_pattern_analysis_results.txt`
- Optimization recommendations

### Option 2: Direct SQL Queries

If you prefer to run queries directly on your database:

1. **Connect to your database** using your preferred tool (pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.)
2. **Run the queries** from `analyze_search_patterns.sql`
3. **Review the results** to understand your data patterns

## 📊 What to Look For

### Political Parties
- How many unique parties exist?
- What are the most common parties?
- Are there abbreviations or variations?

### Address Patterns
- Common suffixes (ge, maa, villa, etc.)
- Common prefixes
- Building names and area names
- Maldivian-specific patterns

### Islands and Atolls
- How many unique islands exist?
- Are there unofficial names?
- Common misspellings or variations?

### Names
- Name length distribution
- Single vs. multiple word names
- Common name patterns

### Professions
- How many unique professions?
- Common profession categories
- Abbreviations or variations

## 🎯 After Analysis

1. **Review the results** to understand your data patterns
2. **Identify optimization opportunities** based on real data
3. **Update the optimization plan** in `SMART_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`
4. **Proceed with implementation** when ready

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Backup your database** before running any analysis
- **Test in development environment** first
- **Review results carefully** before making changes
- **Document your findings** for future reference

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Django Import Error:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the django_backend directory
# Check that Django is properly installed
pip install django
```

**Database Connection Error:**
- Verify your database settings in `dirfinal/settings.py`
- Check that your database is running
- Ensure proper credentials

**Permission Error:**
- Make sure the script has read access to your database
- Check file permissions

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Verify your environment setup
3. Review the Django documentation
4. Check the project status in `PROJECT_STATUS.txt`
