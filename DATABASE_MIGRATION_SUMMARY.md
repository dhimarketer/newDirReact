# Database Migration Summary

## 2025-01-27: Successfully migrated from test database to live database

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Database Configuration Updated**
   - Changed `django_backend/dirfinal/settings.py` to use `app.db` instead of `db.sqlite3`
   - The live database contains **439,009 phonebook entries** and **43 users**

2. **Model Structure Aligned with Live Database**
   - Updated `PhoneBookEntry` model to use `pid` as primary key (matches `t1` table)
   - Removed auto-generated fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`) that don't exist in live data
   - Added `family_group_id` field to match database structure
   - Updated `Image` model to work with actual database schema (`entry_id` references `pid`)

3. **Migration State Established**
   - Applied all Django migrations as "FAKED" since the database already had the structure
   - Django now recognizes the live database as fully migrated

4. **API Endpoints Updated**
   - Updated serializers to work with new model structure
   - Fixed PEP status logic to handle actual values: `1` = PEP, `0` = Not PEP
   - Updated image status filtering to work with actual data values
   - Premium image search now filters by `pep_status='1'` and excludes `image_status='0'`

5. **Frontend Types Updated**
   - Changed all references from `id` to `pid` in TypeScript interfaces
   - Updated components to use `pid` for primary key operations
   - Frontend builds successfully with new type structure

6. **Admin Interface Fixed**
   - Removed references to non-existent timestamp fields
   - Added `pid` and `family_group_id` to admin display
   - System check now passes without errors

### Database Schema Details

**PhoneBookEntry (t1 table):**
- Primary key: `pid` (INTEGER)
- Key fields: `name`, `contact`, `nid`, `address`, `atoll`, `island`, `party`, `DOB`, `pep_status`
- PEP Status values: `1` = PEP (749 entries), `0` = Not PEP (7 entries), empty = Unknown (723 entries)
- Image Status: Some entries have actual filenames, `0` = No image

**Image (images table):**
- Primary key: `id` (INTEGER)
- Fields: `filename`, `entry_id` (references `pid` in t1), `last_modified`

### Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Successfully connected to live database  
✅ **Models**: Aligned with actual database schema  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All working and responding  
✅ **Frontend**: Builds successfully with updated types  
✅ **Migrations**: All applied and recognized  

### Next Steps for Production

1. **Docker Configuration**: Update `docker-compose.prod.yml` to mount `app.db` as a volume
2. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular backups of the live database
3. **Performance**: Consider adding database indexes for frequently searched fields
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging for database operations and API usage

### Files Modified

- `django_backend/dirfinal/settings.py` - Database path
- `django_backend/dirReactFinal_directory/models.py` - Model structure
- `django_backend/dirReactFinal_api/serializers.py` - Serializer logic
- `django_backend/dirReactFinal_directory/admin.py` - Admin configuration
- `react_frontend/src/types/directory.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `react_frontend/src/components/directory/SearchBar.tsx` - Component updates
- `react_frontend/src/components/directory/SearchResults.tsx` - Component updates
- `react_frontend/src/pages/PremiumImageSearchPage.tsx` - Component updates

The system is now ready to use the live database with real data for both development and production deployment.
