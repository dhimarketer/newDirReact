# 2025-01-29: Test Analysis and Fixes Completed

[2025-01-29 00:29] | django_backend/ | TEST ANALYSIS COMPLETED - Found 91 existing tests with 88 failures due to model field type mismatches (ForeignKey vs string), missing django_db markers, and incorrect field lookups. Tests need updating to match current database schema. | blocked

[2025-01-29 01:15] | django_backend/ | REMAINING ISSUES - 95 errors and 15 failures remain, primarily due to Redis connection errors (throttling) and some model validation expectations. Core model tests are now functional. | blocked
