[2025-01-05 10:05] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | CREATED - Implemented Dagre-based automatic layout hook for family tree with spouse unions, parent-child relationships, and proper node positioning | completed
[2025-01-05 10:15] | react_frontend/src/components/family/CleanReactFlowFamilyTree.tsx | REFACTORED - Replaced manual positioning logic (lines 152-229) with useFamilyGraphLayout hook, removed complex union node positioning, simplified component to use Dagre automatic layout | completed
[2025-01-05 10:25] | react_frontend/src/components/family/FamilyTreeWindow.tsx | UPDATED - Replaced ClassicFamilyTree with CleanReactFlowFamilyTree, added type transformation for compatibility, updated console logging to reflect Dagre implementation | completed
[2025-01-05 10:55] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | ENHANCED - Added fallback logic for when API relationships are missing, improved node styling with parent/child color differentiation, enhanced edge styling to match clean organizational chart appearance, fixed infinite loop issues in React Flow state management | completed
[2025-01-05 11:05] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | FIXED - Added proper type checking for member.role and member.role_in_family to prevent TypeError when role is not a string, ensuring robust handling of different data types | completed
[2025-01-05 11:10] | react_frontend | STARTED - Frontend server started using npm start in background | completed
[2025-01-05 11:12] | react_frontend | CORRECTED - Started frontend server using npm run dev (Vite) in existing terminal | completed
[2025-01-05 11:15] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | FIXED - Improved edge handle connections by determining proper source/target handles based on edge type (spouse=horizontal, parent-child=vertical), ensuring edges connect to correct node handles | completed
[2025-01-05 11:15] | react_frontend/src/components/family/CleanReactFlowFamilyTree.tsx | ENHANCED - Updated FamilyNode and UnionNode handle styling with proper colors (#8B4513) and positioning, increased default edge stroke width to 3px, added debug logging for edge creation | completed
[2025-01-05 11:20] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | IMPLEMENTED - Proper organizational chart logic with union nodes for parent connections, children connect to middle of spouse line via invisible union node, improved edge type detection for parent-to-union vs union-to-child connections | completed
[2025-01-05 11:20] | react_frontend/src/components/family/CleanReactFlowFamilyTree.tsx | FIXED - Made union nodes completely invisible (1x1px, opacity 0, no pointer events) to serve as connection points only | completed
[2025-01-05 11:25] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | CRITICAL FIX - Auto-generate spouse relationships between all identified parents when no spouse relationships exist, ensuring horizontal lines connect parents and children connect to union node in center, added debug logging for relationship creation | completed
[2025-01-05 11:30] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | DEBUG ENHANCEMENT - Added comprehensive console logging to track spouse group creation, union node processing, parent-child relationship handling, and fallback logic triggers to diagnose layout issues | completed
[2025-01-05 11:35] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | CRITICAL REWRITE - Fixed parent identification to use actual relationship data like SVG layout (parentChildMap), removed age/role heuristics that created invalid spouse relationships, now only creates spouse relationships between people who actually have children | completed
[2025-01-05 11:40] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | DEBUG FIX - Enhanced spouse relationship creation to check if relationships already exist between parents, improved logging to show spouse group availability and parent-child connection routing through union nodes | completed
[2025-01-05 11:45] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | MAJOR FIX - Added missing parent detection logic to identify family members who should be parents but aren't in relationship data, auto-creates parent-child relationships for missing parents, ensures both parents are identified for proper organizational chart structure | completed
[2025-01-05 11:50] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | CRITICAL FIX - Fixed duplicate edge creation where each parent was creating separate edges to each child, now creates single edge from union node to each child, added duplicate prevention logic and enhanced edge creation debugging | completed
[2025-01-02 02:26] | Analysis | ReactFlow parent detection logic is wrong compared to SVG layout. SVG layout correctly identifies parents using useFamilyOrganization hook with age-based logic, while ReactFlow uses complex relationship parsing that creates wrong parent-child structures | completed
[2025-01-02 02:30] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | MAJOR REWRITE - Replaced complex relationship parsing with same useFamilyOrganization logic as SVG layout, simplified to clean organizational chart structure with horizontal spouse lines and vertical parent-child connections, removed union node complexity | completed
[2025-01-02 02:35] | react_frontend/src/components/family/hooks/useFamilyGraphLayout.ts | CRITICAL FIX - Fixed React Hook Rules violation by moving useFamilyOrganization call outside useMemo, updated dependencies to include parents and children arrays | completed
[2025-01-02 02:35] | react_frontend/src/components/family/CleanReactFlowFamilyTree.tsx | Fixed useEffect dependencies to include setter functions for proper React Hook compliance | completed
