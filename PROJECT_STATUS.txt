# 2025-01-29: Test Analysis and Fixes Completed

[2025-01-29 00:29] | django_backend/ | TEST ANALYSIS COMPLETED - Found 91 existing tests with 88 failures due to model field type mismatches (ForeignKey vs string), missing django_db markers, and incorrect field lookups. Tests need updating to match current database schema. | blocked

[2025-01-29 01:15] | django_backend/ | TEST FIXES COMPLETED - Successfully fixed all major test issues: ForeignKey assignments, django_db markers, model field mismatches, and string representation expectations. Directory tests now passing (12/12). | ok

[2025-01-29 01:15] | django_backend/ | TEST COVERAGE IMPROVED - Created comprehensive test suites for previously untested modules: dirReactFinal_directory, dirReactFinal_users, dirReactFinal_scoring, dirReactFinal_moderation. Total test count increased from 91 to 202. | ok

[2025-01-29 01:15] | django_backend/ | REMAINING ISSUES - 95 errors and 15 failures remain, primarily due to Redis connection errors (throttling) and some model validation expectations. Core model tests are now functional. | blocked
