[2024-12-28 14:20] | USER INPUT: now lets work on family tree edit function.  we already have a family edit capability but its not very intuitive and not working very well even. user shall be able to assign family members to different  positions such as father, mother, son , daughter, grand mother, grand father, son in law, daughter in law, etc. first study current setup and lets design a better more user friendly way to do family edit from scratch if need be. first make a plan and then we will implement the plan
[2024-12-28 15:15] | USER INPUT: still the smart family edit window is too big and  a left side menu is obscuring part of the window. the window itself is too big. so are the buttons.  lets resize it, make controls smaller and move it away from the left side  menu. see the image
[2024-12-28 16:25] | USER INPUT: when user clicks on an address, the faily tree of only that address shall be rembmered. i see when family tree is opened for smart edit, some previous  family member names are there. also the layout shall show son, daughter, son in law, daughter in law also.  currently its showing father, mother, grand father, grand mother.
[2024-12-28 17:30] | USER INPUT: we were earlier working on family tree smart edit family member auto assigining. we have some success. but need more. see image. daughter, son correctly detected. but mother, father, not detected. also if there are multiple sons or daughters they shall be under daugher/son column as daughter 1, daughter 2  etc.
[2024-12-28 17:50] | USER INPUT: i see parents are misidentified as grand parents. this must be from age calculation. but do not do this. check how this is already implemented correctly in svg family tree. system can detect only as parents by age detection method. user will identify grandparents and grand kinds
[2024-12-28 18:10] | USER INPUT: lets add table structure to the form so that its easier to follow visually.
[2024-12-28 18:25] | USER INPUT: good job. user has to be able to drag members to any role
[2024-12-28 18:35] | USER INPUT: now the form is too tall, so user has to scroll. lets  restyle the form to make more use of space economically. let there be a box for son where all sons will be added by name with numeral. but same time user shall be able to drag members by name to other roles
[2024-12-28 18:50] | USER INPUT: now i see previous family members. this is wrong. always clear data when opening smart edit. also keep the table structure
[2024-12-28 19:05] | USER INPUT: still the form is too tall. user has to scroll. lets make the layout more compact
[2024-12-28 19:40] | USER INPUT: still the role table is too wide compared to members table. see image. this is making the form too tall and visually difficult for user.
[2024-12-28 19:45] | USER INPUT: here is the form. can you see a way to conserve space. i see the table on the right is taking too much space because of the cancel button on each row.
[2024-12-28 19:50] | USER INPUT: now after removing the button there is noway to remove a member from role table. how to fix this. lets drag out to remove
[2024-12-28 19:55] | USER INPUT: still i see mixup. here i clicked the family of happy night, sh. goidhoo, but the form is populated with the family of happy night, k. Male'. so its two different families. as mentioned earlier, when user clicks on an address, the form shall open with data of that particular address, previous data shall not be there on the form
[2024-12-28 20:00] | USER INPUT: the issue is not resolved. this must be in search result issue. because as user i am clicking on search result addresses. when i click on a search result address i shall see the family tree of that particular address. not the one before searched
[2024-12-28 20:05] | USER INPUT: now lets add grand children and grand parents also to the roles table in family tree smart edit form. this shall correctly identify the family member position and shall update multi generation family
[2024-12-28 20:10] | USER INPUT: advice needed.  now what happens when a family becomes multi generation. our initial idea was to create a nuclear family for any address. now after user edits the family and make it extended, lets make user specify to create another nuclear family.  case in point. when fathmath nava haneef of habaruge becomes a daughter of Abdulla Haneef, thats another separate nuclear family. with nuha being the daughter and abdulla haneef being the father. lets create this as new family with suggested address with father's name. what do you think?
[2024-12-28 20:15] | USER INPUT: lets hide the left menu which is covering the form . see image
[2024-12-28 20:20] | USER INPUT: the family splitting logic is not yet good. if a grand parent or grand child is created then we shall ask who is the parent of the child is from this existing family. when user  updates this, the 2nd nuclear family is created from 1st nuclear family
[2024-12-28 20:25] | USER INPUT: now this seems to create 3 families. while in fact 1 additional family need to be created. that is nava haneef family. but her father is Abdulla Haneef.  He is still a member of Habaruge family as a son of Mariyam Dhie. how to solve this? here is your given suggestion " Multi-Generational Family Detected

This family spans multiple generations. We suggest creating separate nuclear families for better organization:
fathimath saeeda's Family
Generation 2
Address:
Members (5):
fathimath saeeda (daughter)ibrahim nafiz (son)aishath wafa (daughter)abdulla haneef (son)hussain zaneef (son)
fathmath nava haneef's Family
Generation 3
Address:
Members (1):
fathmath nava haneef (granddaughter)
mariyam dhie's Family
Generation 1
Address:
Members (1):
mariyam dhie (mother)"
